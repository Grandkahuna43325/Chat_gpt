## This is just my project to find out if I can program in node after I took the course


## Installation

Create a variable OPENAI_API_KEY that contains your openai api key. 

When you get the api key paste this command:

```git clone https://github.com/Grandkahuna43325/Chat_gpt && npm i && npm  run dev_start```

Then go to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)

Well if you don't know you need node and npm.
